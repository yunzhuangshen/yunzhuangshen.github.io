I did my PhD@RMIT in machine learning and operations research, advised by Prof. [Xiaodong Li](https://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e46507), Prof. [Andrew Eberhard](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/e/eberhard-professor-andrew), and Dr. [Yuan Sun](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/y6sun). I did a postdoc in Trustworthy machine learning @UTS, under the guidance of Dist. Prof [Jie Lu](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/jie.lu).
