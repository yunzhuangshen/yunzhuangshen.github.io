I am a third-year PhD student at RMIT University, advised by Prof. [Xiaodong Li](https://titan.csit.rmit.edu.au/~e46507), Prof. [Andrew Eberhard](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/e/eberhard-professor-andrew), and Dr. [Yuan Sun](https://yuansuny.github.io/). My research explores the use of machine learning to enhance traditional optimization techniques, such as column generation.
